# SECURITY SYSTEM

In every office there are a confidential rooms or High secured room where only some authorized person can enter that room. 
So for to give Security to that room the “Security system” comes in action.
In this security system there is a 2 layer protection system. One is authorization and another is piezo sensor or (Pressure Sensor). 
Piezo sensor works when some pressure is applied to it. In this Security system the sensor will be Placed under every alternative tiles. If the person enter the room by giving proper authentication then the piezo sensor will not work. And if person enter the room without giving proper authorization  the the piezo sensor will trigger and alert the security room for some intruder is there.
In this project Atmega328 processor is used with a door authorization system and a piezo sensor is connected to it. 
And another connection is given to security room for in that LED light and buzzer is connected. To alert that some intruder has entered the Walt without permission.
