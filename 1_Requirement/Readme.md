HIGH LEVELrequirement
	
	•	AtMega328 microprocessor - A processor is ued to controlling all the Unit in Security System i.e Door and piezo sensor and also led and Buzzer that is connected in Security controlling room.
  
	•	5Volt Voltagesource - to power the ckt.
	•	LED - will be in controlling room.
	•	Switch-  act as a Door passcode opreated.
	•	Push switch - act as a Piezo sensor.
	
	LOW LEVEL Requirement
  
	•	voltmeter - to check voltage across ckt in simulation.
	•	resistor 100ohms.


Swot Analysis 

Strengths
•	Easy to understand the application and use it.
•	Totally automated dont have the manually switch .

Weakness
•	Piezo Senor need pressure to applied at proper pt , .

Opportunities
•	Used In Homes,Offices,High Buildings
Threats
•	Other sensors can be used which have greater efficiency than Piezo sensor.

4W's & 1H
Who
•	Can be used by Security agencies 

What
•	This is a SecuritySystem thatcan be used for Secure walt or confidential room.

When
•	When there is need of high security system .

Where
•	Used In Homes,Offices,High Buildings.

How
•	Developed using AVR based ATMEGA32 and implemented on SimulIDE.
